# flask-notebook-app

## Prototype Notebook CRUD Application for learning Flask & Javascript

This is a small project to consolidate some of my recent learnings on HTML, CSS, JS and Flask. It relies on a MongoDB Atlas cloud database to create, maintain and remove new notebooks, chapters and notes.

Lots to still do and the styling is a mess but some of the core functionality is coming along.

## Pressing TODOs:

- Search capability allowing search by tags, titles or note content
- Replace the textbox editor for a WYSIWYG editor like Summernote
- Lots of CSS cleanup and repo cleanup
- Move CREATE new note feature into something more consistent with the app
- Data validation and delete confirmation
- Tags are clickable and trigger onclick searches
